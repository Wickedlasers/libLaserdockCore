Windows: [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/32it5b2kkvx9qita/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/gavrushkin/liblaserdockcore/branch/master)

# Supported platforms

Windows (msvc2017 x86)
<br>
macOS (clang)
<br>
android (ndk r20 + the latest sdk, arm64/armv7 supported)

# Prepare to development

1) Download Qt Online installer from https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer
2) Run installer and install Qt for mac/windows (the latest version is recommended, library was tested on 5.13)
3) Download the latest stable cmake if you don't have it already https://cmake.org/download/ Minimum cmake version is 3.11

### Qt Creator:
4) Ensure that Cmake  is available in Qt Creator Preferences -> Kits -> CMake. 
5) Check Qt Creator Preferences -> Kits -> Kits page for any warnings

# How to start:

### Qt Creator:

1) Open root CMakeLists.txt. 
2) Setup build dirs and create them manually. Qt Creator won't do it until you check the corresponding checkbox in Preferences -> Kits -> Cmake. However this checkbox can create unnecessary dirs if you decide to change build dir later.
3) Build & run

### Visual Studio:

1) copy dist.local.cmake and rename it to local.cmake
2) Open local.cmake and set the path QT_BASE_DIR to your local Qt installation directory, e.g d:\Dev\Qt\5.13.0\
3) Open x86 "Native tools command prompt for VS 2017" and go to libLaserdockCore dir
4) mkdir build
5) cd build
6) cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017"  ..

Instead of step 1-2 you can set QTDIR manually by passing it to cmake on this step:
<br>
cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" -DQTDIR="d:\Dev\Qt\5.13.0\msvc2017" ..

7) Build & run

### Xcode

1) copy dist.local.cmake and rename it to local.cmake
2) Open local.cmake and set the path QT_BASE_DIR to your local Qt installation directory, e.g /Users/ncuxer/dev/Qt/5.13.0
3) cd libLaserdockCore
4) mkdir build && cd build
5) cmake -G "Xcode" .. 

Instead of steps 1-2 you can set QTDIR on this step:
<br>
cmake -G "Xcode" -DQTDIR="/Users/ncuxer/dev/Qt/5.13.0/clang_64" ..

6) open ldCore.xcodeproj
7) build and run

# Code Style
Code style helps to read and edit the project easier to all of us.  Please follow it.

### Common
Do not use exceptions.     

Do not use tabs symbols in code. You can setup your IDE to save tabs as spaces (1 tab is 4 spaces).

Try to declare float variables with _f_ suffix in a new code - _1.0f_ or _1.f_ instead of _1.0_ or _1_

Try to avoid copy-paste.

### Naming

##### Fields
Recommended class field prefix is _m\_\*_, but try to keep the same style if some old class has other prefix.

##### 
Try to create significant names to variables and functions and avoid short names (except some obvious one like x,y, etc).

### Braces

Please try to keep the existing braces style. 

Clasess/structs/functions should have braces on new line:

class ldClass 
<br>
{
<br>
...
<br>
};

void doSomething() 
<br>
{
<br>
...
<br>
}

for/while/if should have braces in the end of the first line: 

for(int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
<br>
...
<br>
}

It is recommended avoid braces if you have only one line of cycle/if content. Just leave blank line before and after this construction to make it clear.

if(true)
<br>
    doSomething();


##### Classes
Common prefix for all classes/structs is _ld\*_. If some class is strictly connected to one mini-app, you can use app name as second prefix - _ldTunes\*_, _ldClock\*_.

##### Member Order
Recommended class member order: _public, public slots, signals, protected slots, protected, private slots, private_. In each section order is: _enum, static functions, constructor, functions, fields_. 

##### Include Order
From common to local:

\<The corresponding *.h file (if it is cpp file)\>
<br>
\<C++ std module\>
<br>
\<Qt Module with explicit submodule> 
<br>
\<Windows/mac/linux specific>
<br>
\<3rdparty library> 
<br>
"ldCore/../.."
<br>
"Subfolder/ldClass.h" 

Try to sort includes in each subgroup in an alphabetical order.

<br>Try to use forward declaration of classes in *.h files.

### C++11


##### for
When it is possible try to use C++11 syntax _for_ with iterators, e.g _for(const ldClass &myClass : myClasses)_ instead of index-based for. 

##### Const correctness
Try to use const references for classes/structs in arguments whenever it is possible. If some function doesn't change class field and shouldn't do it in future by design mark this function as _const_ (getters usually).

##### enum class
_enum class_ syntax from C++11 is preferrable instead of old-style enum in most cases. For any enum try to avoid if-else long trees and use _switch(){}_ instead.

##### nullptr
In new code use C++11 _nullptr_ keyword. 

##### Field initialization
Use C++11 style of variable initialization if it is possible - in \*.h file. If something is initialized from constructor then initialize it in constructor declaration. And initialize field in constructor itself if you don't have other options. All fields should be initialiazed.

##### auto
Use _auto_ keyword only for iterators and lambdas.

##### Smart pointers
Try to avoid using keywords _delete_ / _free_  and any manul memory operations. Prefer to use _std::unique_ptr_, _std::shared_ptr_ or Qt parent-based object system.


### String

Use QString always when it is possible. char* should be avoided generally. std::string is not so bad but it creates mess with QString conversions so try to avoid it oo.
