/*

Subclass ldVisualizer to create a drawing system for the laser.

Access drawing utility through member m_renderer (ldRendererOpenlase*)
Access sound response utility through member m_musicManager (ldMusicManager*)

Override the following functions for a basic render loop:

    virtual void draw() override;

This function is called every time a new frame needs to be drawn. The implementation is responsible for
drawing the frame using the m_renderer object (ldRendererOpenlase). Render parameters and fame modes
should be set here as well if any non-default values are required.

    virtual void updateWith(ldSoundData *pSoundData, float delta);

This function is called when new audio data is available and processed. Audio data is available by accessing
pSoundData (ldSoundData) for raw data and m_musicManager (ldMusicManager) for advanced algorithms.
m_musicManager values are updated once per call to updateWith(), but can also be accessed directly in draw().

Timing notes:

For draw(), the real-time delay between subsequent calls (and display of corresponding frames) is dependant
on frame sizes and and external settings. The function m_renderer->getLastFrameDeltaSeconds() can be called
in draw() to get the timing for each frame.

updateWith() is called on a fixed timer, every AUDIO_UPDATE_DELTA_S seconds.

Other useful functions:

override getTargetFPS() to enforce a hard maximum limit on the draw rate. Default value is 30 frames per second.
Range is 10-100, recommended 30-60. Can be used along with render params (which provides a soft minimum limit)
to stabilize frame rates when drawing complex scenes.

override getVisualizerName() for name used by the app.
