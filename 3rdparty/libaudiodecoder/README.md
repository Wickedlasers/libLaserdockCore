The Cross-Platform Audio Decoder API (C++)
---------------

libaudiodecoder provides a common interface for low-level compressed audio file decoding on Windows and Mac OS X, giving
you access to raw audio samples. Wrapping the audio APIs provided by Windows and Mac OS X has important benefits:

*   **Portability**: One piece of code compiles and runs on both operating systems.
*   **Reliability**: The native audio APIs on each OS tend to be fairly bug-free.
*   **Cost**: Using the native platform APIs allows you to avoid shipping MP3 and AAC decoders (like ffmpeg and libmad) 
          with your application. Bundling such a decoder often requires royalty payments to the software patent holders. 
          Fortunately, Windows and Mac OS X already come with licensed decoders for applications to use instead, and
          so that's what libaudiodecoder wraps.

In more technical terms, we wrap the ExtAudioFile API (CoreAudio) on Mac OS X, and the Media Foundation API that's been part of Windows since Vista. Unfortunately, it turns out that Media Foundation only works for decoding audio in Windows 7 and greater. 


API at a Glance
===============


```c++
    class AudioDecoder {

        /** Construct a decoder for a given audio file.
            @param filename A UTF-8 string containing the full path to the audio file to open.
		*/
        AudioDecoder(const std::string filename);
        virtual ~AudioDecoder();

        /** Opens the file for decoding */
        int open();

        /** Seek to a sample in the file */
        int seek(int sampleIdx);

        /** Read a maximum of 'size' samples of audio into buffer. 
            Samples are always returned as 32-bit floats, with stereo interlacing.
            Returns the number of samples read. */
        int read(int size, const SAMPLE *buffer);

        /** Get the number of audio samples in the file. This will be a good estimate of the 
            number of samples you can get out of read(), though you should not rely on it
            being perfectly accurate always. (eg. it might be slightly inaccurate with VBR MP3s)*/
        inline int    numSamples()        const;

        /** Get the number of channels in the audio file */
        inline int    channels()          const;

        /** Get the sample rate of the audio file (samples per second) */
        inline int    sampleRate()        const;

        /** Get the duration of the audio file (seconds) */
        inline float  duration()          const;

        /** Get the current playback position in samples */
        inline int    positionInSamples() const;

        /** Get a list of the filetypes supported by the decoder, by extension */
        static std::vector<std::string> supportedFileExtensions()
    };
```

For the complete API, please see audiodecoderbase.h.
Please note that at present, all API calls are blocking and none are considered real-time safe. For best performance, please do not call read() or any other libaudiodecoder function from inside your audio callback.

\* Requires Windows 7+ or greater

If you require support for all the different types of WAVE files (different encodings, bit depths, etc.), check out [libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/). It should also be noted that DRM encrypted files are not supported on any platform.


Example Code
============

The "examples" directory currently contains *playsong*, which demonstrates how to decode an MP3 file with libaudiodecoder
and play out the soundcard with PortAudio. The example requires PortAudio and libaudiodecoder installed, and can be built
with the project files provided for XCode 3 or greater on Mac OS X and Visual Studio 2008 on Windows. Please see the
README is the playsong directory for more compilation instructions.

Compiling
=========

libaudiodecoder requires [SCons](http://www.scons.org) to build. Install that before proceeding.


**Compiling on Windows**

Open a command prompt and run vcvarsall.bat for the Visual Studio compiler version you wish to use.
For example, to compile with Visual Studio 2015 ("MSVC 14.0"), you would run:

    "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\vc\vcvarsall.bat"
    scons debug=1 msvc_version=14.0 target_arch=x86

If you need the library to run on Windows Vista, add this extra argument to scons:

    scons vista_compatible=1


**General Tips and Compiling on Mac OS X**

To compile libaudiodecoder in debugging configuration, run:

    scons debug=1

or for release configuration:

    scons debug=0

To install system-wide on Mac OS X (recommended), run:

    scons debug=0 install




API Stability Warning
=====================

libaudiodecoder was developed primarily with Windows and Mac OS X in mind. Because most application developers on these platforms build and ship their own 3rd party libraries with their products, API changes will be noticed at compile time or during testing. We make no guarantees about the stability of the API at this point, though it's not likely to change too much. 


String Encoding
===============

All strings in the API are assumed to be UTF-8 encoded. 


Authors
=======

libaudiodecoder was originally created by [RJ Ryan](http://rustyryan.net/), [Bill Good](https://github.com/bkgood), and [Albert Santoni](http://www.santoni.ca/albert) from code we wrote for [Mixxx](http://www.mixxx.org/ "Mixxx"). We later refactored the code and rolled it into a separate library for use in [BeatCleaver](http://www.oscillicious.com/beatcleaver/ "BeatCleaver") by [Oscillicious](http://www.oscillicious.com/ "Oscillicious"). By sharing this code, we hope other developers will benefit from it in the same way open source has helped us.
