Compiling
==========

Windows:
    You will need to compile PortAudio with Visual Studio and libaudiofile with
    scons, then add the paths to their headers and .lib files to the 
    MSVC project settings by setting:

    	Project Properties -> Configuration Properties ->
		C++ -> General
		"Additional Include Directories"
		
		then

		Linker -> General 
		"Additional Lirary Directories"

    On Windows, you will also need to:
       1) Copy your portaudio_x86.dll and audiodecoder.dll to your Debug/Release
          build folder(s) inside playsong.
       2) Copy demo.mp3 to the same place.


Mac OS X:
    You will need to compile PortAudio and install it, either with scons or 
    make, and then compile/install libaudiodecoder with scons.

    The XCode project provided should compile and run after that...
